# Fling Corporate Folder

This folder contains the *private* web interface for your side project stats.
By default, it is password protected with the random admin password
that was generated when you ran `fling init`, which is stored in the 
password manager specified in your `fling.json` file.

The data subfolder is autopopulated by the `fling pull` command, and shouldn't be
edited manually. The `web` and `template` folders can be customized.
